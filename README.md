Energy Efficiency Optimization

This project aims to analyze and optimize energy consumption using Python-based data analysis, machine learning, and simulation techniques. It targets buildings, industrial systems, or appliances to improve energy efficiency and reduce environmental impact.

Features

Data collection and preprocessing for energy consumption

Feature engineering and exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Predictive modeling using machine learning (e.g., regression, decision trees)

Optimization techniques (linear programming, genetic algorithms, etc.)

Visualization of energy performance metrics and savings

Configurable parameters for custom use cases (buildings, HVAC systems, etc.)


Technologies Used

Python 3.x

NumPy, Pandas (Data Handling)

Scikit-learn, XGBoost (Machine Learning)

Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly (Visualization)

PuLP / SciPy (Optimization)

Jupyter Notebook / Streamlit (UI, optional)


Installation

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/energy-efficiency-optimization.git
cd energy-efficiency-optimization
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
